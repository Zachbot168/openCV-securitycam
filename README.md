What is OpenCV?

OpenCV, short for open computer vision, is a library of different programming commands built for real-time computer vision and camera work including, motion capture, image recognition, and object detection. 
​For this project in specific, we will be using the motion capture and image recognition software build into the library to create our security camera. 
The features in our security camera will include facial and body recognition which will record when a person enters the camera and a stop recording a couple seconds after the person exits the camera. These recording will be able to be stored with the exact date and time shown in the file names.
